          ## The Brief


          In just 5 days, develop a high-fidelity, fully interactive,
          functioning prototype that solves a problem for a user – that was also
          my persona.

          Valeria is a 31 years old woman who wants to be more active and
          healthy having a better work-life balance.


          **Pain points**


          She is often busy due to her daily activities and spends a lot of time
          trying to find gym classes nearby as she usually uses Google to search
          for places – having to make a decision between all the open tabs on
          her browser on websites she is not registered yet.

          > ### _**“I want to be healthier but I loose my motivation and
          excitement as soon as I start searching for options near me as it
          requires a lot of time and effort.”**_

          #### Challenges


          After conducting the first round of open questions to know more about
          my user, I’ve got a few insights as opportunities to build something
          for Valeria:
      - content: |-
          * **VALERIA WANTS TO EXERCISE MORE + HAVE A PROPER ROUTINE**
          * **FIND GYM CLASSES/FITNESS ACTIVITIES NEARBY**
          * **TRACK FOOD + STEPS + SLEEP + WATER + MEDITATION TIME**
    title: ''
  - backgroundColor: '#FFF'
    column:
      - content: >-
          Once I’ve collected so many useful insights on the first stage, I’ve
          realised I would need to narrow my ideas to start solving one of her
          main problems.
      - content: >-
          My first learning: Focus on solving one of your user’s problems
          instead of all of them. It’s a way for you not to lose yourself during
          the process and also understanding which features will be necessary
          for an MVP. Users will usually bring many problems and expectations
          saying they know what they to solve (and how they want to do it) but
          you need to choose one topic and explore it to understand what the
          user truly need.
  - backgroundColor: '#E2E2E2'
    column:
      - content: >-
          The next step was to focus on the second bullet point above and came
          up with the following Problem Statement:


          ### Valeria is trying to be more healthy and balance work with her
          personal life but finds particularly difficult to be more active as
          she usually needs to use Google/apps to find classes that will fit in
          her time and budget.
      - content: >-
          **What could be the solution?**


          An App that can easily show Valeria all available fitness classes
          nearby so she can quickly apply all her criteria and compare the best
          options for her — and make the right decision keeping her excitement
          on point.

          I’ve started creating an Experience Map to understand what are the
          usual steps Valeria takes when booking a gym class online.


          With the map (on the right), I could clearly see which were the areas
          with a lot of room for improvement and also an opportunity to build
          something that could help Valeria to achieve her goals.

          With the map above, I could clearly see which were the areas with a
          lot of room for improvement and also an opportunity to build something
          that could help Valeria to achieve her goals.
    title: Research
  - backgroundColor: '#E2E2E2'
    column:
      - content: >-
          Valeria was spending too much time researching the classes and
          activities she was interested in and still couldn’t find all the
          information she wanted (e.g. booking classes that are not too busy or
          almost full).


          My first sketches helped me to highlight some tools I thought would be
          important so I could build my first prototype and iterate it during
          some user testing interviews.


          ![](/img/sketches_v1jpeg.jpg)


          After doing 4 user testing sessions with different people (Valeria was
          one of them), I’ve collected some valuable feedback that was showing
          what wasn’t working:




          * Users were expecting the map would know already where they were as
          soon as the app was loaded;

          * “Postcode” on top was confusing;

          * Valeria was missing an easy way where she could check how many
          people will attend a class;

          * The user icon on the top left was looking like a keyhole;

          * Users were missing the taskbar at the bottom.

          * Users were expecting the map to be bigger.


          The feedback collected from all four different users were pretty
          similar so it was easy to understand what I would need to change on
          the prototype. So I’ve created the second version  – also the one I’ve
          decided to move forward with.

          Well, I wasn’t sure if I was on the right track after the changes I’ve
          done since Day #2 so I still had to validate my previous findings
          applying all necessary changes to a new prototype and… TEST TEST TEST
          TEST!

          After testing this last version, users were able to complete their
          tasks smoothly. Some feedbacks were still important to improve the
          whole experience and flow:
      - content: >-
          * Buttons below the map (Find my home/work address) were not necessary
          as they were using the map’s space.

          * The map could still be bigger as it’s part of the app’s main
          functionality.

          * The layout looks fine but it seems a bit heavy.

    column:

          I’ve done a good amount of user testing sessions and collected
          valuable feedback. It was about time to implement the final changes
          after all the iterative process and move on with the high-fidelity
          prototype on Sketch.
      - content: >-
          When I started to create the hi-fi prototype, I thought the whole
          layout was still too blocked will all the lines around buttons and
          structures. The content below the map was also making the whole app
          experience look a bit too busy for a mobile screen.

    column:
      - content: '![](/img/sketches_v2jpeg2.jpg)'
      - content: >-
          I decided to do something: start the whole concept from a blank Sketch
          document – and iterate it again. I once heard that in order for us to
          deconstruct something, we need to have a solid base – and I felt I had
          everything in place to do it. And I will show the final screens and
          user flow a bit later.

      - content: >-
          I’ve spent days 5-9 focused on the Brand Vision for the app – the
          whole visual and UI concept after solving the previous problems. Now
          it was time to implement the concepts and create a meaningful product
          combining both UX and UI findings. It was a good break for myself to
          deconstruct the blocked layout I’ve had previously and move further to
          create something better.

          When it comes to sensations, colours and general communication, Work

          I really wanted to explore the place between Colourful and Gentle as
          the app was meant to give this soft atmosphere while motivating users
          to exercise.

          1) App icon gave space to the profile picture – giving access to your
          account, saved and history.


          2) Wallet/Balance: Moved from the bottom top to sit next to the
          profile.


          3) Map is bigger: as the main feature on the homepage, users can
          quickly explore places nearby.


          4) Filters were removed from the homepage so they are now options that
          will appear once you click on the button.


          5) Recommended and Popular options are now on the main menu bar at the
          bottom.


          6) “Find places near me” is no longer necessary once app will
          automatically do it for users.


          7) Profile moved to the top where the logo was previously placed.


          8) Added the current location on the map so users will know where they
          are.


          9) “Saved Places” is now a section of your personal profile.

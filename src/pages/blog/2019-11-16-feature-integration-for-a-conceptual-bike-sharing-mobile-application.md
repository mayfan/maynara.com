          Lime Bikes is an electric bike service that users find and unlock on
          the mobile app that knows the location of available vehicles via GPS.
          In November 2018 Lime moved to London and now has a fleet of over
          1,000 electric bikes. Lime is founded on a simple idea that all
          communities deserve access to smart and affordable mobility.

          You locate the nearest Lime bike through their smartphone app, scan a
          QR code on the rear mudguard, and the bike should unlock for you. Test
          the brakes, and you’re ready to ride. The rental costs an initial £1
          to unlock the bike, plus 15p for each minute it’s in your possession.
          The system allows users to use mobile app to unlock dockless vehicles
          and park them on the streets when trips are completed – but they must
          avoid the red zones or they will need to pay a £10 fine.

          Our client shared four main points they would like us to take in
          consideration:


          \- Onboarding for new users 


          \- A new annual membership option


          \- Ability to choose or create a multi-point sightseeing tour


          \- Ability to view/browse sight details for major attractions (e.g.
          opening hours, prices, description, map, etc.)

          ### Competitive Analysis


          To understand the transport market a bit further, we conducted a
          competitive analysis of direct and indirect competitors of Lime. We
          also compared some important features from traveling apps as we would
          like to optimise the experience of users when it comes to planning
          holidays and bike tours.

In a two-week sprint, I worked in a team of four to integrate a new feature for the exiting Lime bike mobile application creating a hi-fi clickable prototype. The new feature is added to help customers creating a multi-point sightseeing tour, browse sight details for major attractions, secure rental bikes nearby and a more personalised app experience as a way to retain current customers and attract potential users.

          ## My beliefs as a UX/Product Designer and what I can bring to your
          team


          **Creative & Innovative:** Produce new ideas or insights creating
          innovative products and designs. Seek opportunities for organisational
          improvement. How can we creatively approach the solution to this
          problem?


          **Working with people:** the importance of being empathetic and having
          a true interest in an understanding of others. Recognise and reward
          the contribution of others. Listen and communicate proactively. Being
          open to listen and learn.


          **Persuading and Influencing:** Make effective and positive use of
          political processes to influence and persuade others. Onboard and
          commit a team to pursue the same goal. Convince and negotiate
          expectations.


          **Presenting and communicating information:** Be clear when expressing
          key points. Respond quickly to the needs and feedback of an audience. 


          **Delivering & Meeting customer expectations:** Focus on customer
          needs balancing with business goals. Set high standards for quality.
          Monitor and maintain quality and productivity. Be systematic and
          methodical when necessary. Consistency is a key point to achieve
          project goals.


          **Adapting & Responding to change:** Adapt to changing circumstances
          is fundamental. Accepting new ideas and embracing changes. Adapt
          interpersonal style to suit different people or situations. Deal with
          ambiguity, making positive use of opportunities.

          ## **UX/UI Experience**


          **NIIT Technologies** (November 2019 - present)<br/>

          _UX/Product Designer_


          I led the Product Design work for several of the company’s largest
          digital clients, including a National Library, where I’ve been driving
          the new multi-channel UX/UI/Visual design for their public facing
          website that spans over 28,000+ pages. Prior to that project, I led
          the redesign of a National TV Network Channel’s highly complex and
          highly transactions agency/media purchasing portal servicing over
          3,000+ media agencies. In addition to these two highly complex
          initiatives I’ve been the driving UX/UI/Visual design force behind
          NIIT’s newest industry-leading banking/mortgage design introducing
          hyper-personalisation.

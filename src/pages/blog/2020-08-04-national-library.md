          The National Library has 28,000 pages of content and they lack
          consistency across them, most weren’t either accessible or
          user-friendly. Besides the extensive amount of pages, they were
          divided as a specific number of templates that were replicated
          throughout the whole website. Their previous product had hundreds of
          controls that were built on top of each other, never considering a
          user-centred experience or even their functionality. They were
          originally designed based on the website’s content and on what
          internal stakeholders (e.g. content producers) wanted - which is not
          necessarily what users need.

          My starting point was to go through a research phase with stakeholders
          to understand a handful of templates to kickstart my knowledge of what
          kind of controls were available, going through every component and
          control for each template. After that, I could then start to redesign
          them accordingly to their function and the purpose they had to serve.
          One of the challenges was to redesign controls that could be
          replicated in different templates and combined in different ways. They
          would also need to be consistent with the content that was already on
          the website.

          * Analysed and ran workshops with stakeholders to unify and be
          consistent on the designs across their product.

          * Defined user journeys and stories.

          * Produced high-fidelity wireframes and interactive prototypes.

          * Worked along a Senior UX Designer to define the UX/UI strategy.

          * Applied Atomic Design principles to define a Design System as we had
          to consider their extensive components library.

          * Ensured user experience and visual designs were in alignment with
          WCAG AA requirements.

          * Onboarded internal stakeholders into best design practices and
          approaches for the new controls.

          * Worked with development and testing teams to ensure all UX/UI and
          visual design requirements are being developed, tested and delivered.

          * While designing, made sure online brand guidelines, style guides and
          component library requirements were maintained across the portfolio of
          digital properties.

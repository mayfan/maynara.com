In a two-week sprint, I worked in a team of four to integrate a new feature for the exiting Lime bike mobile application creating a hi-fi clickable prototype. The new feature is added to help customers creating a multi-point sightseeing tour, browse sight details for major attractions, secure rental bikes nearby and a more personalised app experience as a way to retain current customers and attract potential users.

          In a two-week sprint, I worked in a team of four to integrate a new
          feature for the exiting Lime bike mobile application creating a hi-fi
          clickable prototype. The new feature is added to help customers
          creating a multi-point sightseeing tour, browse sight details for
          major attractions, secure rental bikes nearby and a more personalised
          app experience as a way to retain current customers and attract
          potential users.


          CHALLENGES:


          * Onboarding for new users 

          * A new annual membership option

          * Ability to choose or create a multi-point sightseeing tour

          * Ability to view/browse sight details for major attractions

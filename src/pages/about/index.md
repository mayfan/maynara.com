          ## My beliefs as a UX/Product Designer and what I can bring to your
          team


          **Creative & Innovative:** Produce new ideas or insights creating
          innovative products and designs. Seek opportunities for organisational
          improvement. How can we creatively approach the solution to this
          problem?


          **Working with people:** the importance of being empathetic and having
          a true interest in an understanding of others. Recognise and reward
          the contribution of others. Listen and communicate proactively. Being
          open to listen and learn.


          **Persuading and Influencing:** Make effective and positive use of
          political processes to influence and persuade others. Onboard and
          commit a team to pursue the same goal. Convince and negotiate
          expectations.


          **Presenting and communicating information:** Be clear when expressing
          key points. Respond quickly to the needs and feedback of an audience. 


          **Delivering & Meeting customer expectations:** Focus on customer
          needs balancing with business goals. Set high standards for quality.
          Monitor and maintain quality and productivity. Be systematic and
          methodical when necessary. Consistency is a key point to achieve
          project goals.


          **Adapting & Responding to change:** Adapt to changing circumstances
          is fundamental. Accepting new ideas and embracing changes. Adapt
          interpersonal style to suit different people or situations. Deal with
          ambiguity, making positive use of opportunities.

          **Everyone has a story to tell and here is why design and I go well
          together.** I'm May, a passionate Product Designer based in London
          with over nine years’ experience in the Creative Industry. Prior to my
          Product Design career, I worked as a Project Manager across broadcast,
          digital & print. 


          Now, working in global organisations as a Product Designer, I've been
          collaborating with designers and stakeholders to define a consistent
          and user-centred approach, offering both creative and technical-based
          solutions. I’ve built relationships with people of different
          backgrounds, ages, cultures, and perspectives – both professionally
          and personally. 


          Chat to me on all things related to design, cats, coffee, yoga,
          dinosaurs and nature.

          ## **Services Design, development, and strategy**


          **Agile Team Philosophy** Involve users early and often. Learn from
          your users, learn from your team, and iterate. Your process will
          mature and you’ll be able to run through it easier and faster on each
          pass. Being agile is to be set up to react to new information fast.


          **Design Strategy** Movement does not mean progress. It’s just as
          important to focus on the medium and long term as it is to have a
          well-designed product. 


          **Design Sprints** Rapidly save time, money and reduce risk.


          **Design Systems** Efficiency is the key to a well-functioning design
          team. 


          **Web and Mobile App Design**  The end product. Learn more about how I
          arrive at the final solution by checking my case studies.


          **Workshop Facilitation** When a Design Sprint isn’t suitable,
          sometimes a workshop will suffice.

        In a two-week sprint, I worked in a team of four to integrate a new
        feature for the exiting Lime bike mobile application creating a hi-fi
        clickable prototype. The new feature is added to help customers creating
        a multi-point sightseeing tour, browse sight details for major
        attractions, secure rental bikes nearby and a more personalised app
        experience as a way to retain current customers and attract potential
        users.


        CHALLENGES:


        * Onboarding for new users 

        * A new annual membership option

        * Ability to choose or create a multi-point sightseeing tour

        * Ability to view/browse sight details for major attractions

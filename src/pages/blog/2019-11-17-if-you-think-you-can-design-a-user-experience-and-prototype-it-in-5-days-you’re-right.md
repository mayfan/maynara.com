          ## The Brief


          In just 5 days, develop a high-fidelity, fully interactive,
          functioning prototype that solves a problem for a **user** – that was
          also my **persona**.

      Statement and create the Experience Map

          Valeria is a 31 years old woman who wants to be more active and
          healthy having a better work-life balance.


          **Pain points:** She is often busy due to her daily activities and
          spends a lot of time trying to find gym classes nearby as she usually
          uses Google to search for places – having to make a decision between
          all the open tabs on her browser on websites she is not registered
          yet.

          excitement as soon as I start searching for options near me as it
          requires a lot of time and effort.”**_

          ### Challenges


          After conducting the first round of open questions to know more about
          my user, I’ve got a few insights as opportunities to build something
          for Valeria:
      - content: |-
          * **VALERIA WANTS TO EXERCISE MORE + HAVE A PROPER ROUTINE**
          * **FIND GYM CLASSES/FITNESS ACTIVITIES NEARBY**
          * **TRACK FOOD + STEPS + SLEEP + WATER + MEDITATION TIME**
  - backgroundColor: '#FFF'
    column:
      - content: >-
          Once I’ve collected so many useful insights on the first stage, I’ve
          realised I would need to narrow my ideas to start solving one of her
          main problems.
      - content: >-
          **My first learning: Focus on solving one of your user’s problems
          instead of all of them. It’s a way for you not to lose yourself during
          the process and also understanding which features will be necessary
          for an MVP. Users will usually bring many problems and expectations
          saying they know what they to solve (and how they want to do it) but
          you need to choose one topic and explore it to understand what the
          user truly need.**

          The next step was to focus on the second bullet point above and came
          up with the following **Problem Statement**:


          ### Valeria is trying to be more healthy and balance work with her
          personal life but finds particularly difficult to be more active as
          she usually needs to use Google/apps to find classes that will fit in
          her time and budget.
      - content: >-
          **What could be the solution?**


          An App that can easily show Valeria all available fitness classes
          nearby so she can quickly apply all her criteria and compare the best
          options for her — and make the right decision keeping her excitement
          on point.

          I’ve started creating an Experience Map to understand what are the
          usual steps Valeria takes when booking a gym class online.


          With the map (on the right), I could clearly see which were the areas
          with a lot of room for improvement and also an opportunity to build
          something that could help Valeria to achieve her goals.

          Valeria was spending too much time researching the classes and
          activities she was interested in and still couldn’t find all the
          information she wanted (e.g. booking classes that are not too busy or
          almost full).


          My first sketches helped me to highlight some tools I thought would be
          important so I could build my first prototype and iterate it during
          some user testing interviews.


          ![](/img/sketches_v1jpeg.jpg)


          After doing 4 user testing sessions with different people (Valeria was
          one of them), I’ve collected some valuable feedback that was showing
          what wasn’t working:




          * Users were expecting the map would know already where they were as
          soon as the app was loaded;

          * “Postcode” on top was confusing;

          * Valeria was missing an easy way where she could check how many
          people will attend a class;

          * The user icon on the top left was looking like a keyhole;

          * Users were missing the taskbar at the bottom.

          * Users were expecting the map to be bigger.


          The feedback collected from all four different users were pretty
          similar so it was easy to understand what I would need to change on
          the prototype. So I’ve created the second version  – also the one I’ve
          decided to move forward with.

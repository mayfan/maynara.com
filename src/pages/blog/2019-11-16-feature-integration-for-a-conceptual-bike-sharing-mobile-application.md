          In a two-week sprint, I worked in a team of four to integrate a new
          feature for the exiting Lime bike mobile application creating a hi-fi
          clickable prototype. The new feature is added to help customers
          creating a multi-point sightseeing tour, browse sight details for
          major attractions, secure rental bikes nearby and a more personalised
          app experience as a way to retain current customers and attract
          potential users.

          Lime Bikes is an electric bike service that users find and unlock on
          the mobile app that knows the location of available vehicles via GPS.
          In November 2018 Lime moved to London and now has a fleet of over
          1,000 electric bikes. Lime is founded on a simple idea that all
          communities deserve access to smart and affordable mobility.
      - content: >-
          You locate the nearest Lime bike through their smartphone app, scan a
          QR code on the rear mudguard, and the bike should unlock for you. Test
          the brakes, and you’re ready to ride. The rental costs an initial £1
          to unlock the bike, plus 15p for each minute it’s in your possession.
          The system allows users to use mobile app to unlock dockless vehicles
          and park them on the streets when trips are completed – but they must
          avoid the red zones or they will need to pay a £10 fine.
      - content: >-
          Our client shared four main points they would like us to take in
          consideration:


          * Onboarding for new users 

          * A new annual membership option

          * Ability to choose or create a multi-point sightseeing tour

          * Ability to view/browse sight details for major attractions (e.g.
          opening hours, prices, description, map, etc.)

          ### Competitive Analysis


          To understand the transport market a bit further, we conducted a
          competitive analysis of direct and indirect competitors of Lime. We
          also compared some important features from traveling apps as we would
          like to optimise the experience of users when it comes to planning
          holidays and bike tours.

          ### On Site Visit


          To understand the experience of hiring a Lime bike, we conducted a
          site visit and made some interviews to localise the pain points for
          users.


          **Findings:**


          * When it comes to Map Features and Reserving the bikes, only two
          direct competitors were offering those services to clients. I will
          explore both of them later on and explain why we decided to focus on
          them to develop the new feature. Santander also has an advantage as
          the only rental bike service with docking stations – which makes it
          easier for you to rent more than one bike at a time.
      - content: >-
          * Google Trip was the only indirect competitor that offered all the
          services we selected from our original brief so we decided to use it
          as an inspiration of how we could solve our main problems.
  - backgroundColor: '#E2E2E2'
    column:
      - content: >-
          **Findings:**


          * People were on a rush and couldn’t stop to talk to us – a reason why
          most of them were hiring Lime Bikes.

          * Some users felt frustrated because the nearest bikes were not
          charged.

          * The cycle hire scheme was very confusing to some users as they were
          missing an initial onboarding process.

          * Users were not able to calculate routes on the current app so they
          had to keep another app open (e.g. Google Maps).

          * Some of the available bikes showing on the app were actually on some
          people’s gardens.
      - content: >-
          * The hiring price was confusing as they were not sure how long it
          would take or how much they would spend more or less before paying to
          unlock the bike.

          * Users were not able to calculate routes on the current app so they
          had to keep another app open (e.g. Google Maps).

          * Some of the available bikes showing on the app were actually on some
          people’s gardens.

          * The hiring price was confusing as they were not sure how long it
          would take or how much they would spend more or less before paying to
          unlock the bike.

          #### “When I’m cycling, I always need to keep at least two apps open:
          Lime and Google Maps. It’s hard to cycle when you need to check the
          route somewhere else if you are unfamiliar with the location you are
          going to.”

          ### Quantitative Survey


          We sent out a short survey online asking people about their travel and
          commute behaviours in London and if they were used to hiring bikes for
          themselves. Through this method, we were able to filter and recruit
          research participants to conduct more in-depth interviews further on.
  - backgroundColor: '#FFF'
    column:
      - content: '![](/img/survey.png)'
      - content: >-
          35 people responded in total but only 9 matched our criteria to move
          forward with personal user interviews. We tried to recruit two groups
          of interviewees; we wanted to talk to frequent and non-frequent
          cyclists to understand why and how they started cycling so that we
          could address their issues in our product.

    column:

          ### User interviews/Qualitative Survey


          During the interviews, we asked individuals about their travel and
          commute behaviours in more depth. We wanted to understand how they
          travelled and the reason behind their behaviour. Further to this, they
          were also specifically asked about their attitude and feelings towards
          cycling in London or when on holidays.
      - content: >-
          ### Discover Trends and Identify Problems


          An **Affinity map** was generated with a large amount of data and
          quotes from the user interviews and online reviews, a few common
          trends and pain points were identified. After the problem statement
          was formed, we were able to focus on finding solutions and opportunity
          areas that guided our project.

  - backgroundColor: '#E2E2E2'
    column:
      - content: >-
          From those insights, we realised we would need to focus on some
          problems we could solve on the app. Many of the user’s feedback were
          about the quality and physical conditions of the bikes or how they
          were feeling unsafe knowing they would need to cycle without a helmet
          – considering it’s something you don’t necessarily have when hiring a
          bike ocasionally. They were also very vocal about issues they’ve had
          when it comes to pick-up and drop-off (e.g. mentioning the red zones –
          places they are not allowed to park and can be charged a fee if they
          do).
      - content: >-
          **Findings:**


          * People need an easy way to check the route when cycling in an
          unfamiliar environment.

          * Those who do not hire bike on holiday are discouraged by set up
          process.

          * People are less likely to cycle during winter conditions.

          ### Experience Map


          To understand a bit more about our user’s pain points when hiring a
          bike through a mobile app, we created an **Experience Map**.


          ![](/img/expmap.png)
  - backgroundColor: '#FFF'
    column:
      - content: >-
          **Findings:**

          It was clear that stopping to check directions was the main
          opportunity for us to stand out as a product. When cycling, users need
          to stop every once in a while to check the suggested route and see if
          they are following the right path. That’s not only dangerous but it
          also takes time to juggle between apps. If you look back to check the
          other competitors, they were not offering any alternatives when it
          comes to solving this problem either.

          ### Persona


          The insights synthesised from the user interview data has shaped our
          persona for Lime bike, Alex.

    column:

          ### Problem Statement


          An integral part of the design thinking process is the definition of a
          meaningful and actionable problem statement, which the design thinker
          will focus on solving.
      - content: >-
          ### "Alex needs an easy way to organise itineraries by bike to
          discover the city because he currently struggles to find all the
          information in one place."

    column:
      - content: >-
          ### Happy Path


          After defining our persona and understanding his problem, we created
          the happy path: the default user journey that a customer would
          experience if they proceeded to convert without any deviation during
          the process.

          ### App Map

          ![](/img/lb_img3.png)
      - content: >-
          We also created the app map indicating where they would be placed –
          according to user’s feedback.


          (The area highlighted in **black** (left) indicates the new feature we
          designed for the app – and where it would sit according to the current
          app map.)
  - backgroundColor: '#FFF'
    column:
      - content: >-
          With the problem statement and our persona in mind, our team
          brainstormed for various potential solutions. Due to the balance of
          time and resources, create route, reserve bikes and add multiple stops
          were the priorities of the new feature integration. We started
          sketching and creating wireframes for our low-fi prototype.


          **Key point: We knew how important it was to test the low-fi prototype
          straight away as we wanted to collect some feedback from users and see
          if we were moving on the right direction.**

          ### Feature Prioritisation


          With the problem statement and our persona in mind, our team
          brainstormed for various potential solutions. Due to the balance of
          time and resources, we decided to do a feature prioritisation matrix,
          that has an impact axis and an effort axis. We plotted all of the
          ideas that were produce from the second design studio.
    title: ''
  - backgroundColor: '#FFF'
    column:
      - content: '![](/img/featprior.png)'
      - content: >-
          As a group, we placed the features on this matrix, and decided to use
          the features that were high impact for the MVP. These are shown in the
          top two quadrants (in green). These included:


          * **Create route:** Provide a map with the option of creating a route
          with the full route so users can focus on their journey while cycling
          to reach their goal destination.

          * **Group booking:** Book more than one bike in just one process.

          * **Add multiple points:** To ensure users don’t need to create a new
          route every time they want to go to a new place, they will be able to
          add multiple stops during their journey.

          * **Location Radius:** The app will automatically select the nearest
          bikes considering the user’s current location.

          ### HMW?


          How-Might-We questions are a way to frame your ideation, and often
          used for launching brainstorms. This worksheet gives some strategies
          to use your current perspective on the challenge to create different
          How-Might-We questions that may prompt an array of fruitful ideas. The
          goal is to create questions that provoke meaningful and relevant
          ideas; do so by keeping the questions insightful and nuanced.


          Suggests that a solution is possible and because they offer you the
          chance to answer them in a variety of ways. A properly framed How
          Might We doesn't suggest a particular solution, but gives you the
          perfect frame for innovative thinking.

          ### How might we…?

          … help people navigate a new city in an efficient way?



          … help people create a bike group activity whilst travelling?

          ### Usability Testing and Iterations


          Lo-fi clickable prototype was tested. The scenario given to users was
          the following:
      - content: >-
          #### **“Imagine two friends are coming to visit you in London. You
          want to show them the city by bike, as it’s a fun way to get around.
          You know that Lime has a new feature that allows you to plan your
          itinerary and hire multiple bikes.”**
      - content: |-
          ### Tasks

          They had to complete 3 main tasks:

          * Set up the App.
          * Plan a multi-point journey.
          * Book three bikes.
  - backgroundColor: '#FFF'
    column:
      - content: >-
          With all the instructions given to users, a few common problems were
          pointed out and addressed in the second iteration – and refined
          further on the final iteration. The main problems were:


          * Users would like to have the option to skip the onboarding process
          if they wanted.

          * "Create Journey" was expected to be on the main screen, not on the
          burger menu.

          * Users were confused about adding stops to their journey.

          * Map interaction wasn't intuitive to users.
      - content: >-
          ![](/img/group_2.jpg)


          To better understand all feedback we received from V1, we’ve done an
          **Affinity Map** with the main issues and used post-its to find
          patterns on the possible changes we would need to do. That was very
          helpful when you have a lot of feedback and you want to put them
          together to have a visual and better understanding of your next steps.

          ### Visual Guideline


          In order to apply the new features following the current branding of
          our client, we created a design guide with the visual elements of
          Lime. The look and feel of the app follows the original designs and we
          added some illustrations and a few other additional icons to help
          users navigate in the app.

          To continue to grow Lime, a few new features are considered to be
          added. They focus on improving customer service and giving users a
          more personal experience.
      - content: >-
          * Explore the membership options. Considering users are less likely to
          cycle during winter due to weather conditions, maybe offering
          discounts during specific seasons.

          * Add the audio directions for users who have hearing loss or cyclists
          who want to hear the route while riding their bikes (using only one
          side of their earphones so they can still pay attention to the
          traffic).

          * Messaging feature will be considered to connect other Lime users.
          This is beneficial for the users to be able to navigate when
          collecting bikes for a large group of people so they communicate
          between each other as well.
      - content: >-
          * Developing the social media aspect of the app will help the business
          raise brand awareness and continue to grow Lime culture as a brand to
          attract new users.

          * Instant chat and customer service within the app will also help Lime
          users to access instant help and information.

          * More flows and more testing to keep improving our product.

          I truly enjoyed the project and appreciate my supportive teammates who
          were very committed to the excellence we wanted to achieve. We were
          able to brainstorm and express our creative ideas and I felt we were
          all deeply involved in the project. In the end, we combined all of our
          great ideas to the final solutions based only in the research we’ve
          intensively done. Timeline and file-management were also very
          important to the project due to the short project time frame. The
          cross-functional team helped each of the members strictly follow the
          deadline and deliver what we had on the original brief – with clear
          steps of what to do in the next phase of the project.

          **Weekly design sprints in a Scrum/Agile environment.** I took the
          lead as a Product Designer working closely with stakeholders to better
          understand the user and business requirements. I was responsible for
          running workshops, translating needs and goals into designs and flows,
          working closely with developers to understand the tech constraints,
          research with users and stakeholders, creating and updating style
          guides and design systems, producing hi-fidelity prototypes and
          deliverables, testing and iterating prototypes.

          Iâ€™ve worked on two main projects:


          * A platform that services over 3,000 outside media agencies and
          provides programme purchase options, allocation of TV commercials,
          budget management and ROI reports on media allocated. The portal
          itself comprises highly complex journeys for media planning,
          purchasing inventory management and commerce. 

          * An internal system that communicates sales decisions between teams
          from the above system.

          * Defined user journeys and stories.

          * Produced high-fidelity wireframes, interactive prototypes (that were
          also used as part of usability testing sessions) and visual designs.

          * Conducted interviews with end users and internal stakeholders to
          understand business requirements.

          * Completed competitor/market analysis as part of the research phase
          before wireframing.

          * Complied with style guides and component library requirements to
          maintain the digital brand.

          * Created user-centred experiences that met WCAG AA standards.

          * Co-ordinated with development and testing teams to ensure all UX/UI
          and visual design requirements are being developed, tested and
          delivered.

          * Facilitated workshops and final design sessions.

          For my second project as part of the User Experience course at General
          Assembly in London, I was tasked with creating an e-commerce website
          for a local independent grocery shop. 


          My client was **YoShelf** groceries. They’ve been the City’s
          neighbourhood grocery store since 1998. Located near Liverpool Street
          Station, they are proud of being part of a dynamic community.
      - content: >-
          Their business model is based on customer service, reasonable pricing
          and keeping it local — employing local staff and supporting the
          community they serve.


          Through a new e-commerce desktop website, YoShelf wants to showcase
          their products while maintaining their brand image.
      - content: >-
          **CHALLENGES**


          YoShelf defined a few priorities on their brief. The new website must:


          * Have clear ways of locating specific products

          * Support a single page for each product which can be linked to
          directly

          * Have an efficient means of purchasing one or more products

          * Steer costumers toward popular products

          * Establish the brand and its points of difference

          * Allow customers to contact the business (including to request a
          product not otherwise stocked)

          ### Contextual Inquiry


          To understand the problem scope and the experience of users when
          buying groceries, I went to Planet Organic and As Nature Intended to
          understand what were the pain points of customers during their
          shopping process. Both shops were near Liverpool Street Station –
          where YoShelf is also located. I conducted Contextual Inquiry
          observations and interviews with customers and staff to collect
          feedback that could help with my research.

  - backgroundColor: '#E2E2E2'
    column:
      - content: >-
          **Insights:**


          * Customers would ask for a specific product from a brand showing
          staff the requested product with their phones.

          * They would compare prices in-store with prices they were browsing
          online  — knowing they were making the best deal was important.

          * They would browse products but were not sure of what they actually
          needed  — some of them were wishing they’ve brought a shopping list
          instead of randomly wandering around the aisles.
      - content: >-
          **Note:** 


          This exercise confirmed that there was an opportunity to make
          YoShelf’s website a unique offering in the groceries market by
          showcasing their expert advice and also creating an experience on the
          website that supported costumers when buying.

          ### Competitive Analysis


          The second step of the process was to do a Competitive Analysis so we
          could understand what the competitors were doing. I was also looking
          for potential gaps so we could explore and stand out as a groceries
          e-commerce.


          I conducted a research of YoShelf’s direct and indirect competitors
          using the following methods:


          * Features Analysis of competitor’s websites

          * Contextual Inquiry & Site visits to local competitor shops

          * Interviews with shoppers & staff at these competitor shops


          ![](/img/competanal.png)

    column:
      - content: >-
          Waitrose is one of the UK’s biggest groceries shop and it was
          interesting to understand what they were doing. They have a “Recipes”
          section on their website with many different categories but there are
          no actions the users can take from there with the actual products.
          According to the brief, a big and corporate e-commerce website wasn’t
          what my client would want as YoShelf wants to keep its brand image as
          a local small shop focusing on hand-picked quality over quantity.
      - content: >-
          Planet Organic and As Nature Intended were good shops to compare as
          they have some physical shops in East London — and they do offer great
          hand-picked selections for their customers.

          ### User Interviews


          Based on surveys and interviews with customers to understand their
          shopping behaviours, I identified the main needs I wanted to address
          in the website while also taking into consideration the needs of
          YoShelf.
      - content: >-
          * Clear product organisation for a seamless shopping experience

          * Product search to easily find products

          * Helpful Product Suggestions that reflects YoShelf expertise and
          focus on the local area

          * Customer brand relationship to establish trust

          * Detailed product information to ensure proper product selection

          * Product reviews to help make informed buying decisions and allow for
          user input

          * Efficient checkout process to save users time and allow for easy
          purchase of products

          ### Persona


          From my interviews, I’ve synthesised the data collected and created my
          persona. **John** was based upon my research in order to represent the
          different user types that might use our client’s service — it helps us
          to understand the users’ needs, experiences, behaviours and goals.

  - backgroundColor: '#FFF'
    column:
      - content: >-
          John’s journey map was also created to show how his behaviour and pain
          points while buying groceries online.

  - backgroundColor: '#FFF'
    column:
      - content: >-
          ### Findings:


          * John doesn’t always shop online because he needs to know what to buy
          and what he wants to eat — so he usually wastes some time browsing for
          random stuff.

          * He’s currently on a Low-Carb Diet — which links to our “Lifestyle”
          idea that will be introduced later.

          * He would like to buy more on Waitrose but he doesn’t find shops
          nearby — a great opportunity to introduce our e-commerce service.

          * He values great quality and product selection — which YoShelf
          groceries currently offer.

          ### Site Structure & Navigation


          With Information Architecture being an integral part of a customer’s
          experience of a website, I conducted a card sorting exercise using a
          sample inventory of YoShelf’s products. My main finding from this was
          that it was necessary to have two ways of searching for a product:


          1. By product category (e.g. Bakery, Vegetables)


          2. By lifestyle (e.g. Low-Carb, Gluten-Free)
  - backgroundColor: '#E2E2E2'
    column:
      - content: '![](/img/cardsorting.jpg)'
      - content: >-
          During a **Card Sorting** session, participants are asked to organise
          topics/products from the shop inventory into categories that make
          sense to them which could help us label these groups making the
          content more accessible and easy to find. This would be crucial to
          create categories on the website.


          **Insights:**


          * Cultural/Language barriers are a challenge as people come from
          different backgrounds— which leads them to categorise items according
          to their personal experiences/cultures

          * Not all categories are the same to everyone as people have different
          criteria— they are not that obvious

          * If you have a serious allergy conditions/specific diet, you would
          want to shop the products you can consume (e.g. dairy-free/vegan)
  - backgroundColor: '#E2E2E2'
    column:
      - content: >-
          One of my card sorting participants was Vegan so she gave me a very
          precious insight. When it comes to buying groceries, we should
          consider some people follow different lifestyles and they would like
          to feel like there’s somebody paying attention to their needs and life
          choices. Instead of categorising the inventory in
          Meat/Fish/Bakery/etc, the vegan user classified as:
      - content: >-
          ![](/img/vegan2.png)


          My main learning from this feedback is that buying groceries can be
          actually painful for some people with dietary restrictions. So **why
          not change it so we can make those users feel cared and respected?**

          ### Sitemap


          A Sitemap is a diagrammatic representation of a hierarchical system.
          It usually depicts the parent-sibling relationship between pages in a
          website, showing how subpages might be arranged underneath their
          parent groupings. So I’ve created YoShelf’s **sitemap**:

          ### Global Navigation

          How users would find what they need in the website

  - backgroundColor: '#E2E2E2'
    column:
      - content: '![](/img/iterative.png)'
      - content: >-
          To understand if we were on the right path for this project, we tested
          the first prototype with some users following the iterative process. 


          Once, through user research, you have identified a user need and have
          generated ideas to meet that need, you develop a prototype. Test,
          collect feedback and refine. Following that, you create a new
          prototype and begin the process all over again until you are satisfied
          that you’ve reached the best possible product for release to the
          market as an MVP.

          During my testing sessions, I gave the users a scenario and **three
          tasks** for them to complete — imagining they were John:
      - content: '![](/img/tasks.png)'
  - backgroundColor: '#E2E2E2'
    column:
      - content: >-
          After that, I created the **Happy Path** for John — steps he would
          need to take to complete all given tasks according to the scenario:


          ![](/img/happypath2.png)
      - content: >-
          My first couple of testing insights were:


          * It wasn’t clear to users what “Lifestyle” meant

          * Delivery Option — you need to know the shipping cost will be added
          later — it should be mentioned somehow

          * Users were confused about the menu — words were too close with no
          separation between them

          * We would need to have a page confirming your purchase/order
          confirmation will be sent via e-mail

          Over the course of a week, I did over 15 usability tests over five
          prototype iterations. My mid-fidelity homepage (on the left) to a
          high-fidelity (on the right):

          ### Solutions


          If we take a closer look to the Homepage:


          1) Global Navigation Menu: An easy way for you to find yourself
          through the website — it will appear on every single page in case you
          want to use one of the Menu options.


          2) Browse Your Lifestyle: an easy way to help the customers finding
          what they need. The pictures and words help users to understand what
          “Lifestyle” means.


          3) Meet our staff: To keep the sense of a local business where you can
          meet the staff and get in touch if customers want to. Once they click
          and are redirected to the staff page, customers will be able to read
          some recommendations and interesting content produced by the
          staff — for example, interesting recipes or recommended products.


          4) Hand-Picked selections: The importance of highlighting the business
          cares about what they sell — quality over quantity. 


          5) Bottom Menu: Customers can sign in to the newsletter and receive
          offers and news (about the shop or the local community) and clients
          can also get in touch if they want (via phone, or social media). The
          main point here is to establish a connection between the business and
          the customer.

          ## Next Steps

          * Develop the “Guided Shopping” tool
          * Apply colours to all screens and create a high-fidelity prototype
          * Continue testing with users

          ## What I’ve learnt…


          I’ve learned how important it is to document every single step of the
          whole process. As a UX Designer, the amount of data we can collect is
          impressive and it’s quite important to keep a track of the whole
          process. As it was a solo project, it was a Research and Ideation
          process I’ve had full control over from the brief until final
          delivery. Working on a brief like this was both challenging and
          incredibly rewarding! As this was a concept project, I was unable to
          go back to the client with our findings and had to find a way to
          incorporate user insights with the brief.

          **Leading Product Designer:** responsible for the end-to-end process
          for multiple features in the core platform - built to quickly and
          accurately extract, classify and interpret virtually any information
          from any document to make smarter business decisions, eliminate manual
          processing and optimise data flow. This Natural Language Processing
          tool helps users get structured insights in seconds by simply asking
          questions. A no-code AI platform where business users can easily
          extract data, answer questions and retrieve information. Some of the
          capabilities are:


          * The user labels the relevant data fields for extraction. The
          platform uses this information to build a machine learning model.

          * The model analyses all documents to retrieve the correct data points
          and evaluates the accuracy, giving the user a performance percentage
          score.

          * The user can easily apply logic and add rules to make the data
          output instantly understandable and actionable.

          * The platform guides users to verify any low-confidence answers,
          which can be used to further improve accuracy where necessary.

          * The user can review and, if required, retrain answers before
          exporting the resulting data or sending it other systems.

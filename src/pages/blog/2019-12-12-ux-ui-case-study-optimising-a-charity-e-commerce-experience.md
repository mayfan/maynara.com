          Dementia is the UK’s biggest killer. Someone develops it every three
          minutes and there’s currently no cure. Alzheimer’s Society is the only
          UK charity that campaigns for change and supports people living with
          dementia today.




          As the largest and most influential dementia charity in the UK, they
          fund research into the cause, cure, care and prevention of the
          disease. They also campaign to change society and funds research and
          innovation to improve care and ultimately find a cure.




          The Alzheimer’s Society Online Shop sells assistive products to help
          people to live well with dementia. Alongside this, they sell a wide
          range of cards and gifts, branded merchandise and books on dementia.

          **Everyone has a story to tell and here is why design and I go well
          together.** I'm May, a passionate product designer based in London
          with over nine years’ experience in the Creative Industry. Prior to my
          Product Design career, I worked as a Project Manager across broadcast,
          digital & print. 


          Now, working in global organisations as a Product Designer, I've been
          collaborating with design and stakeholders to define a consistent and
          user-centered approach, offering both creative and technical-based
          solutions. I’ve built relationships with people of different
          backgrounds, ages, cultures, and perspectives – both professionally
          and personally. 


          Chat to me on all things related to design, cats, coffee, yoga,
          dinosaurs and nature.

          ##### 2019-2020 / Web


          Weekly design sprints in a Scrum/Agile environment. Took the lead as a
          Product Designer working closely with stakeholders to better
          understand user and business requirements. I was responsible for
          running workshops, translating needs and goals into designs and flows,
          working closely with developers to understand the tech constraints,
          research with users and stakeholders, creating and updating style
          guides and design systems, producing hi-fidelity prototypes and
          deliverables, testing and iterating prototypes.


          I’ve worked on two main projects:


          * A platform that services over 3,000 outside media agencies and
          provides programme purchase options, allocation of TV commercials,
          budget management and ROI reports on media allocated. The portal
          itself comprises highly complex journeys for media planning,
          purchasing inventory management and commerce. 

          * An internal system that communicates sales decisions between teams
          from the above system.

          In a two-week sprint, our team had to re-design the whole online shop
          to attract customers to purchase daily living aids and increase the
          revenue for the charity.

          <br/><br/>

          #### CHALLENGES


          * Helping users better understand the products, including their
          features, benefits and related advice

          * Ensuring that their USP is clear, in the context of the competitive
          landscape

          * Improving the way that VAT / VAT relief information and options are
          presented 

          * Improvements to the overall UX and UI of the shop

          feature for the existing Lime bike mobile application creating a high

          ## The Brief


          In just 5 days, develop a high-fidelity, fully interactive,
          functioning prototype that solves a problem for a **user** – that was
          also my **persona**.

      Statement and create the Experience Map

          Valeria is a 31 years old woman who wants to be more active and
          healthy having a better work-life balance.


          Pain points: She is often busy due to her daily activities and spends
          a lot of time trying to find gym classes nearby as she usually uses
          Google to search for places – having to make a decision between all
          the open tabs on her browser on websites she is not registered yet.

          excitement as soon as I start searching for options near me as it
          requires a lot of time and effort.”**_

          ### Challenges


          After conducting the first round of open questions to know more about
          my user, I’ve got a few insights as opportunities to build something
          for Valeria:
      - content: |-
          * **VALERIA WANTS TO EXERCISE MORE + HAVE A PROPER ROUTINE**
          * **FIND GYM CLASSES/FITNESS ACTIVITIES NEARBY**
          * **TRACK FOOD + STEPS + SLEEP + WATER + MEDITATION TIME**

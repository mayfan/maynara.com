          ## Ship fast, learn and iterate. 


          I help companies define, design and launch world-class digital
          products following Agile principles. I learn and grow, working from an
          initial need, betting on the right solution, questioning assumptions.
          By addressing all the details during the process, I make independent
          and data-driven decisions when needed. I encourage making user-centred
          experiences for users to drive business outcomes. Eager to identify
          work to do and learn; focused on finding solid solutions to problems.

          ##### 2019-2020 / Web


          Took the lead as a Product Designer working closely with stakeholders
          to better understand user and business requirements. I was responsible
          for running workshops, translating needs and goals into designs and
          flows, working closely with developers to understand the tech
          constraints, research with users and stakeholders, creating and
          updating style guides and design systems, producing hi-fidelity
          prototypes and deliverables, testing and iterating prototypes.


          I’ve worked on two main projects:


          * A platform that services over 3,000 outside media agencies and
          provides programme purchase options, allocation of TV commercials,
          budget management and ROI reports on media allocated. The portal
          itself comprises highly complex journeys for media planning,
          purchasing inventory management and commerce. 

          * An internal system that communicates sales decisions between teams
          from the above system.

          ##### 2020 / Web + Mobile


          The National Library has 28,000 pages of content and they lack
          consistency across them, most weren’t either accessible or
          user-friendly. Besides the extensive amount of pages, they were
          divided as a specific number of templates that were replicated
          throughout the whole website. Their previous product had hundreds of
          controls that were built on top of each other, never considering a
          user-centered experience or even their functionality. They were
          originally designed based on the website’s content and on what
          internal stakeholders (e.g. content producers) wanted - which is not
          necessarily what users need.

          Pro-bono project. In a two-week sprint, our team had to re-design the
          whole online shop to attract customers to purchase daily living aids
          and increase the revenue for the charity.

          <br/><br/>


          #### CHALLENGES


          * Helping users better understand the products, including their
          features, benefits and related advice

          * Ensuring that their USP is clear, in the context of the competitive
          landscape

          * Improving the way that VAT / VAT relief information and options are
          presented 

          * Improvements to the overall UX and UI of the shop

          In a two-week sprint, I worked in a team of four to integrate a new
          feature for the existing Lime bike mobile application creating a high
          fidelity clickable prototype. The new feature is added to help
          customers creating a multi-point sightseeing tour, browse sight
          details for major attractions, secure rental bikes nearby and a more
          personalised app experience as a way to retain current customers and
          attract potential users.

          <br/><br/>


          #### CHALLENGES


          * Onboarding for new users 

          * A new annual membership option

          * Ability to choose or create a multi-point sightseeing tour

          * Ability to view/browse sight details for major attractions

          #### CHALLENGE


          How to be more healthy and balance work with her personal life but
          finds particularly difficult to be more active as she usually needs to
          use Google/apps to find classes that will fit in her time and budget.

          For my second concept project as part of the User Experience course at
          General Assembly in London, I was tasked with creating an e-commerce
          website for a local independent grocery shop.


          My client was YoShelf groceries. They’ve been the City’s neighbourhood
          grocery store since 1998. Located near Liverpool Street Station, they
          are proud of being part of a dynamic community.

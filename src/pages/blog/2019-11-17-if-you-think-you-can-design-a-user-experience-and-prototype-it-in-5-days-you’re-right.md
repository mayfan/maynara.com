          ## The Brief


          In just 5 days, develop a high-fidelity, fully interactive,
          functioning prototype that solves a problem for a **user** – that was
          also my **persona**.

      Statement and create the Experience Map

          Valeria is a 31 years old woman who wants to be more active and
          healthy having a better work-life balance.


          **Pain points:** She is often busy due to her daily activities and
          spends a lot of time trying to find gym classes nearby as she usually
          uses Google to search for places – having to make a decision between
          all the open tabs on her browser on websites she is not registered
          yet.

          > ### _**“I want to be healthier but I loose my motivation and
          excitement as soon as I start searching for options near me as it
          requires a lot of time and effort.”**_

          ### Challenges


          After conducting the first round of open questions to know more about
          my user, I’ve got a few insights as opportunities to build something
          for Valeria:
      - content: |-
          * **VALERIA WANTS TO EXERCISE MORE + HAVE A PROPER ROUTINE**
          * **FIND GYM CLASSES/FITNESS ACTIVITIES NEARBY**
          * **TRACK FOOD + STEPS + SLEEP + WATER + MEDITATION TIME**
  - backgroundColor: '#FFF'
    column:
      - content: >-
          Once I’ve collected so many useful insights on the first stage, I’ve
          realised I would need to narrow my ideas to start solving one of her
          main problems.
      - content: >-
          **My first learning: Focus on solving one of your user’s problems
          instead of all of them. It’s a way for you not to lose yourself during
          the process and also understanding which features will be necessary
          for an MVP. Users will usually bring many problems and expectations
          saying they know what they to solve (and how they want to do it) but
          you need to choose one topic and explore it to understand what the
          user truly need.**

          The next step was to focus on the second bullet point above and came
          up with the following **Problem Statement**:


          ### Valeria is trying to be more healthy and balance work with her
          personal life but finds particularly difficult to be more active as
          she usually needs to use Google/apps to find classes that will fit in
          her time and budget.
      - content: >-
          **What could be the solution?**


          An App that can easily show Valeria all available fitness classes
          nearby so she can quickly apply all her criteria and compare the best
          options for her — and make the right decision keeping her excitement
          on point.

          I’ve started creating an Experience Map to understand what are the
          usual steps Valeria takes when booking a gym class online.


          With the map (on the right), I could clearly see which were the areas
          with a lot of room for improvement and also an opportunity to build
          something that could help Valeria to achieve her goals.

          Dementia is the UK’s biggest killer. Someone develops it every three
          minutes and there’s currently no cure. Alzheimer’s Society is the only
          UK charity that campaigns for change and supports people living with
          dementia today.
      - content: >-
          As the largest and most influential dementia charity in the UK, they
          fund research into the cause, cure, care and prevention of the
          disease. They also campaign to change society and funds research and
          innovation to improve care and ultimately find a cure.

          The Alzheimer’s Society Online Shop sells assistive products to help
          people to live well with dementia. Alongside this, they sell a wide
          range of cards and gifts, branded merchandise and books on dementia.

          * Helping users better understand the products, including their
          features, benefits and related advice. Alzheimer’s disease is the most
          common form of dementia but there are many others with different
          symptoms and rates of progression. The quality of information and
          advice about daily living aids is very important so users are able to
          compare features and understand the benefits of the products.

          * Ensuring that their USP is clear, in the context of the competitive
          landscape. As the scale of dementia increases, commercial retailers
          see a market opportunity. Their USP is the quality of products and the
          fact that 100% of their profits support the good work of the charity.
      - content: >-


          * Improving the way that VAT / VAT relief information and options are
          presented. Many of their daily living aids are available VAT free to
          people with dementia or a qualifying medical condition and those
          purchasing on their behalf. Those needs must be declared at the point
          of purchase before check out.

          * Any suggestions for improvements to the overall UX and UI of the
          shop.

          “Alzheimer’s Society recognises the value that digital user experience
          and inclusive design can make to meeting the needs of our service
          users, along with our strategic mission. However, we currently have a
          single UX Architect to run user-centred design practice across our
          total estate of dementia support services and products.
      - content: >-
          This serious experience design resource bottleneck, along with our
          limited budget/resources as a charity, means that our shop service has
          never received the investment in UX that it deserves. It's affecting
          our ability to raise vital income from our shop. It is also affecting
          how we join-up people in crisis with products which would help people
          affected by dementia to live well and longer in their own homes.”

          Double Diamond is the name of a design process model developed by the
          British Design Council in 2005. Divided into four phases — Discover,
          Define, Develop and Deliver — it is probably the best known and the
          most popular design process visualisation.




          The main feature of the Double Diamond is its emphasis on the
          “divergent” and “convergent thinking”, where first many ideas are
          created, before refining and narrowing down to the best idea. This is
          happening twice in this model—once to confirm the problem definition
          and once to create the solution. That’s the approach we’ve used for
          this project.

          As an established and well-known brand, Alzheimer’s Society has been
          conducting internal reports for years. As part of their customer
          satisfaction research, we were able to utilise important feedback
          provided by their users.


          All that data helped to guide us in understanding how we could start
          the project by analysing the opportunities from each insight. My main
          contribution here was the ability to synthesise user research and draw
          valuable insights to inform our final solution. I provided
          recommendations backed by real data and insights.

          As a way to understand more about what competitors were doing when
          selling daily living aids, we selected some examples of dos and
          don’ts. Competitive analysis helps us to understand and explore
          opportunities and gaps in the market.

          Things competitors did **well**:

          * Ability to search for daily living aids by specific needs
          * Clearly communicating the VAT relief

          **Bad** things competitors did:

          * Cluttered homepage
          * Product information not clearly highlighted

          To validate the data shared by our client, we wanted to understand
          more about users’ motivations. We ran a short survey at the end of
          Alzheimer’s Society checkout process helping us to track some pain
          points throughout the journey.


          We asked users:


          * Why did they choose to shop at the Alzheimer’s Society online shop?

          * How easy was it to find the product they were looking for?

          * What would help to make their purchase decision?


          We had **157 respondents** who have purchased from the online shop.
          After filtering through the information collected, six points stood
          out:


          * Supporting the charity was the main reason why users chose to buy at
          Alzheimer’s Society.

          * Users bought from the shop as they were browsing for specialised
          products.

          * Videos and more product pictures would help me to understand how to
          use the product.

          * Product reviews and key features are important when it comes to
          purchasing a daily living aid.

          * Easier navigation would make the journey smoother.

          * The checkout process was too long with too many steps.


          Part of our discovery phase was to also conduct in-depth interviews.
          People who recently bought living-aid products gave us important
          feedback when it comes to purchasing with our client’s competitors.

          > _“My general thought about those sorts of sites (charities) its that
          they are a bit clunky and difficult to use. There’s one major
          incentive that would change my behaviour in that sense and make me
          actively want to buy their products. I would do it to support the
          charity because it makes sense to put money back into research to find
          a cure for dementia.”_


          To summarise our insights and quotes from users to understand patterns
          an affinity map was created with our main findings.


          The combination of both testing sessions and checkout survey helped us
          to map the customer journey when using the current website. We also
          ran testing sessions on the current website to create an emotional map
          where we could see the main pain points. Users were asked to complete
          the purchase of a specific product and talk about the steps taken
          throughout.

          * **Online shop not visible from the main website.** When visiting the
          Alzheimer’s Society main website, customers mentioned the link to the
          shop was not visible. The button that leads users to the online shop
          wasn’t showing on the mobile responsive layout. That was a big problem
          because many customers were not aware that our client had products to
          sell online.

          * **Customers were not aware that the shop offered more than gifts and
          merchandise.** Most charities offer only gifts, cards and branded
          merchandise as a way to customers show their support. It wasn’t clear
          to users that Alzheimer’s Society had specialised products to offer to
          help people living with dementia.
      - content: >-
          * **Users were confused about categories and sub-categories.** The
          overwhelming amount of categories available to users were leading to
          confusion. They were not aware of where to go first and some category
          names didn’t link to what they really meant.

          * **Product info wasn’t easy to scan.** Users would like to know more
          about the products as they are specialised. When it comes to buying
          daily living aids, users said it would be great to understand how they
          can use what they’re purchasing.

          * **The checkout process was a bit long.** Customers were a bit
          disappointed due to a long checkout process – especially because there
          was some confusion when it comes to applying for the VAT relief.

          Dementia is the UK’s biggest killer. Someone develops it every three
          minutes and there’s currently no cure. Alzheimer’s Society is the only
          UK charity that campaigns for change and supports people living with
          dementia today.
      - content: >-
          As the largest and most influential dementia charity in the UK, they
          fund research into the cause, cure, care and prevention of the
          disease. They also campaign to change society and funds research and
          innovation to improve care and ultimately find a cure.

          The Alzheimer’s Society Online Shop sells assistive products to help
          people to live well with dementia. Alongside this, they sell a wide
          range of cards and gifts, branded merchandise and books on dementia.

          * Helping users better understand the products, including their
          features, benefits and related advice. Alzheimer’s disease is the most
          common form of dementia but there are many others with different
          symptoms and rates of progression. The quality of information and
          advice about daily living aids is very important so users are able to
          compare features and understand the benefits of the products.

          * Ensuring that their USP is clear, in the context of the competitive
          landscape. As the scale of dementia increases, commercial retailers
          see a market opportunity. Their USP is the quality of products and the
          fact that 100% of their profits support the good work of the charity.

          * Improving the way that VAT / VAT relief information and options are
          presented. Many of their daily living aids are available VAT free to
          people with dementia or a qualifying medical condition and those
          purchasing on their behalf. Those needs must be declared at the point
          of purchase before check out.

          * Any suggestions for improvements to the overall UX and UI of the
          shop.

          “Alzheimer’s Society recognises the value that digital user experience
          and inclusive design can make to meeting the needs of our service
          users, along with our strategic mission. However, we currently have a
          single UX Architect to run user-centred design practice across our
          total estate of dementia support services and products.
      - content: >-
          This serious experience design resource bottleneck, along with our
          limited budget/resources as a charity, means that our shop service has
          never received the investment in UX that it deserves. It's affecting
          our ability to raise vital income from our shop. It is also affecting
          how we join-up people in crisis with products which would help people
          affected by dementia to live well and longer in their own homes.”

          Double Diamond is the name of a design process model developed by the
          British Design Council in 2005. Divided into four phases — Discover,
          Define, Develop and Deliver — it is probably the best known and the
          most popular design process visualisation.




          The main feature of the Double Diamond is its emphasis on the
          “divergent” and “convergent thinking”, where first many ideas are
          created, before refining and narrowing down to the best idea. This is
          happening twice in this model—once to confirm the problem definition
          and once to create the solution. That’s the approach we’ve used for
          this project.

          As an established and well-known brand, Alzheimer’s Society has been
          conducting internal reports for years. As part of their customer
          satisfaction research, we were able to utilise important feedback
          provided by their users.

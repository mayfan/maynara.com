          Dementia is the UK’s biggest killer. Someone develops it every three
          minutes and there’s currently no cure. Alzheimer’s Society is the only
          UK charity that campaigns for change and supports people living with
          dementia today.
      - content: >-
          As the largest and most influential dementia charity in the UK, they
          fund research into the cause, cure, care and prevention of the
          disease. They also campaign to change society and funds research and
          innovation to improve care and ultimately find a cure.

          The Alzheimer’s Society Online Shop sells assistive products to help
          people to live well with dementia. Alongside this, they sell a wide
          range of cards and gifts, branded merchandise and books on dementia.

          * Helping users better understand the products, including their
          features, benefits and related advice. Alzheimer’s disease is the most
          common form of dementia but there are many others with different
          symptoms and rates of progression. The quality of information and
          advice about daily living aids is very important so users are able to
          compare features and understand the benefits of the products.

          * Ensuring that their USP is clear, in the context of the competitive
          landscape. As the scale of dementia increases, commercial retailers
          see a market opportunity. Their USP is the quality of products and the
          fact that 100% of their profits support the good work of the charity.
      - content: >-


          * Improving the way that VAT / VAT relief information and options are
          presented. Many of their daily living aids are available VAT free to
          people with dementia or a qualifying medical condition and those
          purchasing on their behalf. Those needs must be declared at the point
          of purchase before check out.

          * Any suggestions for improvements to the overall UX and UI of the
          shop.

          “Alzheimer’s Society recognises the value that digital user experience
          and inclusive design can make to meeting the needs of our service
          users, along with our strategic mission. However, we currently have a
          single UX Architect to run user-centred design practice across our
          total estate of dementia support services and products.
      - content: >-
          This serious experience design resource bottleneck, along with our
          limited budget/resources as a charity, means that our shop service has
          never received the investment in UX that it deserves. It's affecting
          our ability to raise vital income from our shop. It is also affecting
          how we join-up people in crisis with products which would help people
          affected by dementia to live well and longer in their own homes.”

          Double Diamond is the name of a design process model developed by the
          British Design Council in 2005. Divided into four phases — Discover,
          Define, Develop and Deliver — it is probably the best known and the
          most popular design process visualisation.




          The main feature of the Double Diamond is its emphasis on the
          “divergent” and “convergent thinking”, where first many ideas are
          created, before refining and narrowing down to the best idea. This is
          happening twice in this model—once to confirm the problem definition
          and once to create the solution. That’s the approach we’ve used for
          this project.

          As an established and well-known brand, Alzheimer’s Society has been
          conducting internal reports for years. As part of their customer
          satisfaction research, we were able to utilise important feedback
          provided by their users.


          All that data helped to guide us in understanding how we could start
          the project by analysing the opportunities from each insight. My main
          contribution here was the ability to synthesise user research and draw
          valuable insights to inform our final solution. I provided
          recommendations backed by real data and insights.

          As a way to understand more about what competitors were doing when
          selling daily living aids, we selected some examples of dos and
          don’ts. Competitive analysis helps us to understand and explore
          opportunities and gaps in the market.
    title: Competitive Landscape
  - backgroundColor: '#FFFFFF'
    column:
      - content: |-
          Things competitors did **well**:

          * Ability to search for daily living aids by specific needs
          * Clearly communicating the VAT relief

          ![Competitors](/img/competitors1.png)
      - content: |-
          **Bad** things competitors did:

          * Cluttered homepage
          * Product information not clearly highlighted

          To validate the data shared by our client, we wanted to understand
          more about users’ motivations. We ran a short survey at the end of
          Alzheimer’s Society checkout process helping us to track some pain
          points throughout the journey.


          We asked users:


          * Why did they choose to shop at the Alzheimer’s Society online shop?

          * How easy was it to find the product they were looking for?

          * What would help to make their purchase decision?


          We had **157 respondents** who have purchased from the online shop.
          After filtering through the information collected, six points stood
          out:


          * Supporting the charity was the main reason why users chose to buy at
          Alzheimer’s Society.

          * Users bought from the shop as they were browsing for specialised
          products.

          * Videos and more product pictures would help me to understand how to
          use the product.

          * Product reviews and key features are important when it comes to
          purchasing a daily living aid.

          * Easier navigation would make the journey smoother.

          * The checkout process was too long with too many steps.


          Part of our discovery phase was to also conduct in-depth interviews.
          People who recently bought living-aid products gave us important
          feedback when it comes to purchasing with our client’s competitors.
    title: DISCOVERY
  - backgroundColor: '#E2E2E2'
    column:
      - content: >-
          > _“My general thought about those sorts of sites (charities) its that
          they are a bit clunky and difficult to use. There’s one major
          incentive that would change my behaviour in that sense and make me
          actively want to buy their products. I would do it to support the
          charity because it makes sense to put money back into research to find
          a cure for dementia.”_


          To summarise our insights and quotes from users to understand patterns
          an affinity map was created with our main findings.


          The combination of both testing sessions and checkout survey helped us
          to map the customer journey when using the current website. We also
          ran testing sessions on the current website to create an emotional map
          where we could see the main pain points. Users were asked to complete
          the purchase of a specific product and talk about the steps taken
          throughout.

    column:
      - content: >-
          * **Online shop not visible from the main website.** When visiting the
          Alzheimer’s Society main website, customers mentioned the link to the
          shop was not visible. The button that leads users to the online shop
          wasn’t showing on the mobile responsive layout. That was a big problem
          because many customers were not aware that our client had products to
          sell online.

          * **Customers were not aware that the shop offered more than gifts and
          merchandise.** Most charities offer only gifts, cards and branded
          merchandise as a way to customers show their support. It wasn’t clear
          to users that Alzheimer’s Society had specialised products to offer to
          help people living with dementia.
      - content: >-
          * **Users were confused about categories and sub-categories.** The
          overwhelming amount of categories available to users were leading to
          confusion. They were not aware of where to go first and some category
          names didn’t link to what they really meant.

          * **Product info wasn’t easy to scan.** Users would like to know more
          about the products as they are specialised. When it comes to buying
          daily living aids, users said it would be great to understand how they
          can use what they’re purchasing.

          * **The checkout process was a bit long.** Customers were a bit
          disappointed due to a long checkout process – especially because there
          was some confusion when it comes to applying for the VAT relief.

          ## Let’s take a walk in Holly’s shoes


          Holly needs to help her mum to be more independent because her mum is
          suffering from memory loss and Holly can’t always be around to help
          her.


          To brainstorm ideas that could help solve users’ problems, we ran a
          design studio session with our client.  It involves sketching possible
          solutions, sharing and then refining the ideas.


          To guide this process we considered the following “How Might We”
          questions:




          ## **How might we?**


          * Communicate key product features and benefits so it’s easy for Holly
          to read and understand?

          * Communicate that the shop also offers daily living aids rather than
          just gifts and branded merchandise?

          * Better display labels and sub-categories for products so Holly can
          easily find the right product?

    column:

          According to our research, the categories were one of the main pain
          points in the journey. So our next step was to consider what
          categories would improve navigation. For that, we conducted a card
          sorting activity. Users were asked to assign Alzheimer’s Society shop
          inventory items into predefined categories. The suggested categories
          were based on our audit of other charity websites. 


          Card sorting activity also helped us to create sub-categories.

          ## Paper prototype


          We took the "How might we?" questions to our design studio session
          that was done with our client.

          Next, we sketched combinations of our best and most voted ideas on
          paper to run the first set of tests with users.

    column:
      - content: >-


          ## Affinity map – V1


          To group the survey results we collected, we created an affinity map
          to help visualise the pages that would still need to be changed
          through the iterative process. After testing the paper prototype, many
          issues appeared in the flow.


          ![Affinity Map](/img/afmap1.png)


          _Homepage, product page and applying VAT relief info were the most
          problematic parts of the flow._


          After seeing the homepage was one of the most problematic pages in the
          flow, the team had two different ideas so we conducted an A/B testing.


          **A/B test:** experiment where two variants of a page are shown to
          users at random to see which one performs better. We ran two rounds of
          testing sessions with 12 users in total.


          ![A/B testing](/img/ab-testing.png)


          * **Concept A:** Focused on the “What we offer” section and then
          showing users they can shop by product, need or stage of the disease.
            * **Problem:** “Shop by” as a tab menu was too confusing as users thought the homepage was too cluttered and overwhelming.
          * **Concept B:** Highlighting that users could shop by need, gifts or
          from the printed catalogue.
            * **Problem:** “Catalogue” concept was confusing to users and the “What we offer” section wasn’t looking like buttons as the copy wasn’t appropriate.

          ## Affinity map – V2


          ![Affinity map](/img/afmap2.png)


          **User Testing Insights**


          Most painful points on the flow:


          * **Homepage.** It still wasn’t easy and intuitive for users to browse
          as they had a few issues trying to find the right products.

          * **Categories page.** Users thought the page was a repetition of the
          dropdown menu.

          * **Product detail page.** VAT relief and product key features were
          not clear to users.

          * **Applying VAT relief:** It wasn’t intuitive and clear to users when
          they should apply the information about the patient in order to get
          the VAT relief.


          After collecting all feedback from testing sessions, we iterated the
          prototype making the changes that would make the flow smoother to
          users.


          ![Paper changes](/img/paper-changes.jpg)
  - backgroundColor: '#FFF'
    column:
      - content: >-










          We combined A and B concepts to create our final homepage.


          ![Before and After - Homepage](/img/before-and-after-home.png)


          * Changed the daily living aids category title to “Specialised
          products” – as a result of our card sorting and iterative process.

          * Main categories on global navigation are clear and simply showing
          what the shop offers – specialised products, gifts & cards and branded
          products.

          * Highlighting the “Donate” function with the accent colour.

          * Dropdown menu to improve navigation being able to shop by product,
          need or stage – from our research, most users were not sure what to
          buy so “shop by need” was helpful when guiding them to the right
          product.

          * Adding context for the different ways to shop for daily living aids
          (product, need and stage).


          ![Before and After - Menu](/img/before-and-after-menu.png)


          * Clear design for the bottom global navigation

          * Giving the option so users can shop by product, need or stage


          # Improving the product details page


          When testing our paper prototype, users were confused when choosing
          the right product. “What is it good for?” was an idea that came from
          our design studio to highlight the different ways of using the product
          with icons or pictures. Users thought icons could be quite confusing
          and not really meaningful.


          Delivery cost below the product price was also confusing. Users
          thought that was the only delivery option. They were also not sure how
          the website would know this information without their address
          information.


          ![Product page - paper prototype](/img/paperprot_product.png)


          **Improvements:** 


          * Prioritising the product benefits and key features above other
          product information – both can be quickly scanned.

          * Removed delivery price.

          * De-cluttered the product page.

          * Added info about the regular price (without VAT relief).


          ![Before and After - Product](/img/before-and-after-product.png)


          # Clearly communicating USP


          ![Before and After - USP](/img/before-and-after-usp.png)


          # VAT relief process


          One of our suggestions for the website was immediately implemented to
          their current website:


          ![](/img/vat.png)


          From our testing sessions with users, it was a clear way for them to
          see where they would need to apply the information to get the VAT
          relief applied to their purchase.
    title: How did we improve the homepage?

    column:
      - content: >-


          ## Design Elements


          To apply visual elements to our prototype, we’ve used the existing
          brand guidelines. Forms and buttons style were applied throughout all
          pages for consistency. We kept the main blue colours but the light
          blue was used to represent the call to action. On the previous
          website, calls to action could either be blue, green or pink and that
          was confusing to users.


          ![Style Guide](/img/styleguide.png)


          We added grey to the colour palette to counterbalance the bright
          colours. Grey was already being used on the website but wasn’t
          highlighted on the guidelines. New icons were also included following
          the current brand style.

          ![](/img/mobile.png)


          ## Next Steps


          * Think about segments – first-time visitors vs. regular customers.

          * Develop the whole flow on mobile and iterate.

          * Further card sorting to refine categories.

          * Revisit tone & voice to soften the language and elevate brand
          personality.

          * Improve visibility of shop on mobile from the main Alzheimer's
          Society homepage.

          Working with the Alzheimer’s Society was very rewarding for me. I’ve
          learnt more about the incredible work they do at the charity and how
          they want to improve the lives of people living with dementia. The
          charity’s main goal is that each individual affected by the disease
          can live well and longer in their own homes. It was challenging to
          deal with such a delicate subject to users – when it comes to buying
          specialised products for their loved ones. Our UX Design group
          received a lot of support from them with all the data provided to help
          us guide our research. I believe these design changes will improve the
          overall user experience and in particular streamline the donation
          process. I’m hoping that those changes result in an increase in
          donations and purchase of daily living aids. This will help more
          people living with the disease and everyone around them.
